# A Programmer's Guide to Karaoke Templaters
Click [here](#first-steps) to go to the important part.

This guide is **not** a full guide on how to make KFX, but rather a quick explanation of the core ideas that should get you started well enough to start reading your favorite templater's documentation.
It mostly contains a touched-up version of a long explanation I wrote on Discord at some point, as well as some tables explaining how to convert between the three established templaters.
Basically, it's the guide that I would have wanted when learning this.

If you're looking for actual guides on KFX, here are some links:
- [Zahuczky's KFX Guide](https://zahuczky.com/01-kfx-guide-introduction/): Still WIP at the time of writing.
- [Jocko's Posts](https://jockotan.wordpress.com/2015/08/12/karaoke-templater/): Also very concise and example driven, but uses the stock templater.
- The actual documentation of the various templaters, linked below.

Furthermore, I have a collection [here](misc_kara.md) of miscellaneous templates I made for typesetting or other purposes that aren't song styling.

## Existing Templaters
At the time of writing (2022), there are three major karaoke templaters around:
1. The stock templater shipped with Aegisub, documented [here](https://aegisub.org/docs/latest/automation/karaoke_templater/) as part of the Aegisub documentation. The documentation is very detailed, but rather technical.
2. [KaraOK](https://github.com/logarrhythmic/karaOK), a modified version of the stock templater together with a utility library. It's also shipped by default with some newer Aegisub versions like [AegisubDC](https://github.com/Ristellise/AegisubDC).
3. [The0x539's Templater](https://github.com/The0x539/Aegisub-Scripts/blob/trunk/src/0x.KaraTemplater.moon), documented [here](https://github.com/The0x539/Aegisub-Scripts/blob/trunk/doc/0x.KaraTemplater.md) in its repository. This is a fully rewritten templater with more powerful execution logic (mixins, stronger conditionals, nested loops, etc) and more sensibly organized variables.

Except for furigana and other uses of `furi` or `multi` templates, there isn't really anything the stock templater or KaraOK can do that cannot be easily ported to The0x's templater.
As long as it's installed, The0x's templater also contains drop-in support for KaraOK's utility library.
That's why it will be the default templater for this guide, together with notes on how the equivalent concepts work in other templaters.
Even if you'll never write templates in other templaters, the latter can still be useful for understanding *existing* templates.

### See also
There exist some other notable tools for making KFX. They're not explained here as they work very differently, but they're still worth mentioning.
- [KaraEffector](https://github.com/KaraEffect0r/Kara_Effector), a big collection of existing templates and ways to modify them
- [PyonFX](https://github.com/CoffeeStraw/PyonFX), a python library for generating `.ass` subtitles, tailored to KFX
- [aegsc](https://github.com/butterfansubs/aegsc), a compiler outputting `.ass` scripts (especially karaoke templates) that allows for writing templates with more convenient formatting.

## Getting Started
This guide uses [The0x539's Templater](https://github.com/The0x539/Aegisub-Scripts/blob/trunk/src/0x.KaraTemplater.moon), which you'll need to install first (I also strongly recommend you to bind its function to a keyboard shortcut. I use Ctrl+Alt+S.). The guide interleaves semi-technical explanations (formatted normally) with very simple but concrete examples (formatted in italics). You can also follow just the italics if you want a purely hands-on approach.

### Preamble: How to use a Templater
If you're not yet experienced with subtitling and the ASS format, you need to understand the following before trying to learn to use a templater:

**Karaoke templaters are *not* magic.**

A mistake many beginners make is thinking of a karaoke templater (and, similarly, Aegisub's automation scripts) as a magic box that takes in some cryptic looking code and outputs some nice visual effect.
Thus, they ask questions like "How can I write a template that makes the text look like this?".
But this is incorrect: A karaoke templater cannot magically achieve any visual effect.
Instead, a templater is just a tool that takes in some code and outputs *subtitle lines*, and these subtitle lines are then drawn by the renderer just like any other lines are.
Hence, templaters are no more powerful than the ASS format itself: If some visual effect can't easily be achieved using ASS subtitles, they can't easily be achieved using a templater either.
A templater only helps you in *producing* the final ASS lines more efficiently.
In theory, any karaoke effect could also be achieved manually without a templater, e.g. by just manually typing in all the lines and transform tags you need (and, in fact, doing just that for a very simple karaoke effect can be a great exercise!).
This is very tedious and error-prone, but it's possible. It's this tedious part that a templater helps you automate.

For someone who actually wants to create a karaoke template, this means the following:
Instead of asking "How can I write a template that makes the text look like this?", you should instead ask the following two separate questions:
1. How can I achieve this effect using some amount of ASS lines (with which override tags, transforms, etc)
2. How can I tell the templater to produce this set of ASS lines I want it to produce?

Of course, experienced users will intuitively combine these two steps, but if you're ever confused, this is how you should think about things.

Similarly (and maybe even more importantly), this also applies to how you should *debug* karaoke templates.
If your karaoke effect doesn't look like you want it to look, you shouldn't just blindly mess with the template until it works out, but instead examine the ASS lines it outputs.
Do you understand why those ASS lines look the way they look on screen?
Are these ASS lines the ones you wanted your templater to generate, or are they different somehow? (For example: Are there any malformed tags? Any invalid numbers?)
Asking questions like these will help you find out what part of your template you need to fix, and whether the problem lies in the template itself, or in your mental model of the ASS lines you want to generate.

(It's timed to [this OP](https://animethemes.moe/anime/fatezero_2nd_season/OP-NCBD1080) if you want to play around with it.[^1])
[^1]: In no way do I claim that this is perfect styling, I'm just trying to use a decent font almost everyone has. Feel free to play around with it.

It contains
- A style
- Some commented k-timed lines having this style, marked with `kara` in their Effect field
- One single (blank, for now) commented line having this style, marked with the Effect `template line`.

*When running the Macro `The0x539's Templater`, the templater will see the `template line` line.
For every line marked `kara` with the same style as this line, it will generate a line with the text of the kara line, without the k-timing tags.
These outputted lines will be marked `fx` so that they can be deleted or replaced later.*

Note that different templaters use slightly different keywords for some of these markers:
| Concept | In Stock Templater | In KaraOK | In The0x's Templater |
| ---- | ------------------ | --------- | -------------------- |
| Karaoke line marker | `karaoke` | `karaoke` | `kara` or `karaoke` |
| Template applying tags once to each line | `template pre-line` | `template line` | `template line` |

This is the beginning of a larger list of differences between templaters. The [tables](#comparison) at the bottom of this guide show the full list of differences.

*Next, try to write `{\fad(150,150)}` into the text of the `template line` line, and apply the template.
This will give every generated `fx` line these fade tags. So we've already built a worse version of HYDRA using karaoke templates.*

What's happening here is that before turning a `kara` line into an `fx` line using a `template line`, the templater will add whatever the `template line` line contains in front of the `kara` line's (stripped) text.
Now, the interesting part is that this can't only contain static text, but also Lua expressions. These are wrapped in exclamation marks.

*For example, if you change the template line line's text to `{\fad(!2*50!, 150)}`, you'll get a bunch of lines with `\fad(100,150)` tags, because what was in the exclamation marks was evaluated to 100 using Lua.*

Furthermore, in this Lua environment, the templater gives you access to all necessary information about your `kara` line.
This is stored in the `orgline` table, which has the format of the standard table describing an `.ass` line, but also contains lots of additional fields added by karaskel or by The0x's templater.
The karaskel fields are documented [here](https://aegisub.org/docs/latest/automation/lua/modules/karaskel.lua/#dialogue-line-table) while The0x's fields are documented in the templater's documentation.

*For example, `orgline.duration` is the duration of the `kara` line.
So if you put `{\t(0,!orgline.duration/2!,\fscx150\fscy150)\t(!orgline.duration/2!,!orgline.duration!,\fscx100\fscy100)}` in your `template line`, this would create an effect that makes each line get bigger and smaller over its duration.
If the line is 1000ms long, this will turn into `{\t(0,500,\fscx150\fscy150)\t(500,1000,\fscx100\fscy100)}`.*

Lua eval is one of the two additional features available in templates.
The other consists of inline variables prefixed by `$`, which will be directly substituted with their value.
This happens before evaluating Lua expressions.

*For example, the inline variable `$ldur` also evaluates to the line's duration.
So the above template could also be written as `{\t(0,!$ldur/2!,\fscx150\fscy150)\t(!$ldur/2!,$ldur,\fscx100\fscy100)}`.
Note that the last occurrence of `$ldur` is not wrapped in exclamation marks, as its value can be directly substituted into the command text.
However, the previous two instances still need to happen inside of a Lua eval block to perform arithmetic operations with them afterwards.*

The inline variables for the stock templater are documented [here](https://aegisub.org/docs/latest/automation/karaoke_templater/inline_variables/).
KaraOK adds a character index variable `$ci`.
However, The0x's templater removes most of these inline variables.
You can see which ones are still available [here](https://github.com/The0x539/Aegisub-Scripts/blob/4d00d789d4897a04687fa7f66d3dce29dae64b64/src/0x.KaraTemplater.moon#L750-L775).
However, this is not really a restriction, as all of their values (and more) are accessible via `orgline` and friends.

### Syllables
Up to now, we've just added some tags to every k-timed `kara` line, without ever using the actual k-timing.
But now that we've introduced Lua eval and inline variables, we're ready to make sensible syllable-based effects.

*If we replace the effect of our `template line` line with `template syl` and apply the template again, the templater will suddenly generate multiple `fx` lines for each `kara` line - one `fx` line for each k-timed syllable of the `kara` line.
If you didn't remove the scaling effect we made before, they'll all be stacked on top of each other at the top of the screen.
If you did remove it, they'll be moved successively further down until they cover the whole screen.*

This is because, by default, the generated syllable `fx` lines don't have any formatting whatsoever, so naturally they'll just follow the alignment dictated by their style.
To position them correctly, we need to use `\an` and `\pos` tags together with some of the variables the templater gives us.
We've used `orgline` before, and `orgline.left` gives us the x position of the left edge of the `kara` line, when formatting it with whatever style it has.
Similarly, `orgline.top` gives us the y coordinate of the top edge.

To put each individual syllable where it needs to go, we can use the analogous `syl` table, which (obviously) contains similar information about the syllable.
Most importantly, `syl.left` contains the x position of the syllable's left edge, *relative to the line it's in*.

*With this in mind, we can write the following into our `template syl`: `{\an7\pos(!orgline.left+syl.left!,!orgline.top!)}`.
If we now reapply our template, all the syllables will be at the correct position.*

*Now, while `\an7` was the easiest example, but it's rarely convenient for any actual effects.
So let's instead use, `{\an5\pos(!orgline.left+syl.center!,!orgline.middle!)}` which uses the analogous variables for the x and y positions of the middle of the line or syllable.
This doesn't change the positioning, but uses `\an5` instead, which is more useful in almost all cases.*

On the stock templater or KaraOK you might also find inline variables like `$scenter` and `$lmiddle` used for these[^2].
We don't need `syl` for the y position, since the syllable's y position isn't dependent on the line with normal formatting.
In fact `syl.middle` doesn't even exist.
[^2]: I am aware that `$smiddle` also exists, but I'm trying to highlight the `$s[var]` and `$l[var]` pattern.

*With everything we know now, we can already make a simple template.
The only remaining pieces we need are the variables `syl.duration`, `syl.start_time`, and `syl.end_time`, which are the syllable's duration and start and end times in milliseconds respectively, with the latter two again being relative to the current line's start time.
With this, we can make a simple template*
```
{\an5\pos(!orgline.left+syl.center!,!orgline.middle!)
\t(!syl.start_time!,!syl.start_time+syl.duration/2!,\fscx130\fscy130)
\t(!syl.start_time+syl.duration/2!,!syl.end_time!,\fscx100\fscy100)}
```
*that highlights each syllable by making it larger and smaller again.*

*Note: This is only an example styling, designed to be as simple as possible. It is not perfect styling, nor is it styling you should copy at all. Its biggest problem is that the scaling on syl highlights follows a simple triangle curve: It grows for half of the syllable's duration, and shrinks for the other half. This will make short syllables grow and shrink very quickly, while the more dragged out syllables grow and shrink very slowly, reaching their peak size far too late. For actual song styling, you should instead make the highlight follow something resembling an [ADSR Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)#ADSR), i.e. leave the growing and shrinking times somewhat constant and instead sustain the highlight effect for some time for longer syllables.*

**I've now explained most of the basics of templating, and hopefully you should now be able to read the documentation of the various templaters or dissect existing templates ([these](misc_kara.md), for example) to dive deeper. Read on if you want primers on some of the more specific concepts.**

### Multiline effects and mixins
Our `template syl` generates one `fx` line for each input syllable.
If we want to make an effect that generates multiple lines for each syllable we can add more `template syl` line. (For more complex effects, we can also use loops.)

*For example, let's add a blue-ish glow effect to our karaoke lines.
Take the `template syl` line we've made before, and duplicate it.
Increase the second one's layer by one, and add `\3c&HFFCCCC&\bord5\blur5` to the first one.
If you now apply the template, there will be two `fx` lines generated for each syllable - one for each `template syl`.
The `fx` lines will also have the same layers as their respective `template syl` lines.*

But if we're not careful (as happened in this example), this now duplicates a lot of our template code. If we want to change some element of the highlight effect, we'd need to change both `template syl` lines. This is where mixins are very helpful.

Mixins are a way to apply additional tags (or any text, really) to some subset of the *generated* `fx` lines. For example, by default a `mixin syl` line will add its content to every syllable in every generated line, no matter if it's from a `template line` or a `template syl`. By using modifiers like `layer`, `t_actor`, or `if` and `unless`, we can restrict what lines a mixin applies to. This is very useful both for cleaning up templates and removing duplicate code, and for conditional formatting.

*In our case, we can rewrite our template as follows:*
```
[layer 0] template syl: {\3c&HFFCCCC&\bord5\blur5}
[layer 1] template syl:
             mixin syl: {\an5\pos(!orgline.left+syl.center!,!orgline.middle!)
                         \t(!syl.start_time!,!syl.start_time+syl.duration/2!,\fscx130\fscy130)
                         \t(!syl.start_time+syl.duration/2!,!syl.end_time!,\fscx100\fscy100)}
```
*In fact, by splitting up the `mixin` into multiple parts, we can separate the different parts of this template by their purpose, and make it easier to read:*
```
[layer 0] template syl: {\3c&HFFCCCC&\bord5\blur5}
[layer 1] template syl:
             mixin syl: {\an5\pos(!orgline.left+syl.center!,!orgline.middle!)}
             mixin syl: {\t(!syl.start_time!,!syl.start_time+syl.duration/2!,\fscx130\fscy130)
                         \t(!syl.start_time+syl.duration/2!,!syl.end_time!,\fscx100\fscy100)}
```
Mixins (at least in this capacity) are a feature that's unique to The0x's templater. Read its documentation to find all of the possible modifiers for conditional execution.

### Code Lines
Now that we have all the basic functionality, we can talk about code lines. These just allow you to write Lua code which is run either once, or once for every line, syllable, word, or character.
Simple uses include defining constants or functions which compute values you need in your templates. They're pretty self-explanatory, and everything else important is explained in the documentation, so here's just a quick usage example to round off our example template:

*Right now, our template makes syllables grow larger over the first half of their duration, and grow smaller over the second half. If we want them to get larger faster, we can instead use something like `syl.start_time + 0.3 * syl.duration` in the `\t` tags instead. But now, we need to type the `0.3` twice. If we want to change the value later, we might forget one of the two and break the effect. So let's put this into a constant variable:*
```
             code once: growtime = 0.3
[layer 0] template syl: {\3c&HFFCCCC&\bord5\blur5}
[layer 1] template syl:
             mixin syl: {\an5\pos(!orgline.left+syl.center!,!orgline.middle!)}
             mixin syl: {\t(!syl.start_time!,!syl.start_time+growtime*syl.duration!,\fscx130\fscy130)
                         \t(!syl.start_time+growtime*syl.duration!,!syl.end_time!,\fscx100\fscy100)}
```
*While we're at it, let's also give some of the other constants names:*
```
             code once: growtime = 0.3; growscale = 130; glowcol = "&HFFCCCC";
[layer 0] template syl: {\3c!glowcol!\bord5\blur5}
[layer 1] template syl:
             mixin syl: {\an5\pos(!orgline.left+syl.center!,!orgline.middle!)}
             mixin syl: {\t(!syl.start_time!,!syl.start_time+growtime*syl.duration!,\fscx!growscale!\fscy!growscale!)
                         \t(!syl.start_time+growtime*syl.duration!,!syl.end_time!,\fscx100\fscy100)}
```
*We could also have a separate `code once` line for each constant, that's just a matter of taste.*

*To not need to type `!syl.start_time+growtime*syl.duration!` twice, we could also turn this into a variable. We can either do this with a `code syl`, or with the `set` function:*
```
             code once: growtime = 0.3; growscale = 130; glowcol = "&HFFCCCC";
[layer 0] template syl: {\3c!glowcol!\bord5\blur5}
[layer 1] template syl:
             code  syl: growt = syl.start_time+growtime*syl.duration
             mixin syl: {\an5\pos(!orgline.left+syl.center!,!orgline.middle!)}
             mixin syl: {\t(!syl.start_time!,!growt!,\fscx!growscale!\fscy!growscale!)
                         \t(!growt!,!syl.end_time!,\fscx100\fscy100)}
```
*or*
```
             code once: growtime = 0.3; growscale = 130; glowcol = "&HFFCCCC";
[layer 0] template syl: {\3c!glowcol!\bord5\blur5}
[layer 1] template syl:
             mixin syl: {\an5\pos(!orgline.left+syl.center!,!orgline.middle!)}
             mixin syl: {!set("growt", syl.start_time+growtime*syl.duration)!
                         \t(!syl.start_time!,!growt!,\fscx!growscale!\fscy!growscale!)
                         \t(!growt!,!syl.end_time!,\fscx100\fscy100)}
```
*The latter is probably easier to read, but the former can be cleaner if you need this variable in multiple templates or mixins.*

### Functions
The templaters provide various useful functions to further modify the current line.
They're all documented in the respective templater's documentations.
I just want to highlight the arguably most important one, called `retime`.

The `retime` function allows you to change the timing of the output line.
There isn't any magic involved here - the `line` table always contains the fields of the line currently being currently generated and can be changed by anyone, so nobody is stopping you from writing `!(function() line.start_time = 1234 end)()!` to set the generated `fx` line's start time to `1:23`.
The `retime` function just makes this much more convenient.

*For example, even with `template syl`, the generated line uses the timing of the original `kara` line by default.
If you instead want it to only appear when the syllable is being highlighted, you could add `!retime("syl")!` to your template to set its start and end time to the (absolute) start and end time of the syllable, respectively.
If you want a lead-in and lead-out of 150 and 300 milliseconds respecively, you can write `!retime("syl", -150, 300)!`.
If you instead want the syllable to disappear right when it should start getting highlighted, you can use `!retime("start2syl")!` instead.
Check the documentation for all the possible modes.*

### Loops
Finally, let's talk about loops.
You can use loops in templates to create more complex effects, like generating multiple lines from each application of any one `template` line.
You can also set the number of iterations during runtime.
With The0x's templater, you can even use multiple nested loops.
Using the `util.fbf` function, you can also easily set up a loop generating one output line for each frame.
Mixins also support loops in The0x's templater.

*For example, consider a line with the Effect `template line loop myloop 5` and the text*
```
{!relayer($maxloop_myloop - $loop_myloop)!
\an5\pos(!line.center - $loop_myloop - 1!,!line.middle + $loop_myloop - 1!)}
```
*to make something like a solid shadow. Or you could have a simple `template line` with the text*
```
{!util.fbf("line")!\an5
\pos(!line.center + 100 * math.sin(2 * (line.start_time - orgline.start_time) / 1000)!, !line.middle!)}
```
*to make the line smoothly move from side to side.*

For frame-by-frame effects not using positioning, you might also be interested in [KaraOK's wave functions](https://github.com/logarrhythmic/karaOK#wave-table---pushing-the-limits-of-ass), which are also available in The0x's templater.

### Other
Some things I haven't mentioned here are:
- Actors: Making effects behave differently (say, have different colors) depending on the Actor fields of the `kara` lines
- Inline FX: Using markers in the `kara` lines to have different effects for individual syllables
- The other very powerful conditional execution features of mixins, particularly `if` and `unless`
- Gradients using the utility library of The0x's templater, as well as the color library
- Furigana styling.

Again, read the documentation to see what is possible there.

## Comparison

The main differences between the stock or KaraOK templaters and The0x's one are:

- The `mixin` component and `word` class
- Lack of the `multi`/`furi` classes/modifiers
- Most dollar-variables need to instead be accessed through the `tenv` tables in inline lua
- Named and nestable loops
- Conditional execution (applicable to all components, not just `mixin`)

A more complete listing can be found below.

**Note that all links to code sections in the various templaters are permalinks and might be outdated.**

### Tables in tenv
- Throughout all templaters, `orgline`, `syl`, `char`, and `word` (where present and applicable) refer to *original* objects, while `line` refers to the `fx` line that will be generated.
- In the stock templater and KaraOK, `syl` is the current syllable for `template syl` lines, but it's the current *character* for `template char` lines. In fact, `template char` just translates to a `template syl` with a per-char flag internally.
- The newer templaters add tables describing the current word or syllable for `template char` lines:
    - In the stock templater, `word` and `char` don't exist.
    - KaraOK adds tables `char`, `word`, and `syll` (the latter two are also accessible via `char.word` and `char.syll` in `template char`) referencing the current character, word, and syllable in `template char`.
    - In The0x's templater, however, `syl`, `char` and `word` exist only for `template syl`, `template char`, and `template word` respectively, and refer to the respective object. The current syllable or word can be accessed with `char.syl` and `char.word` respectively.

### Other members of tenv
Apart from the various line tables, utility functions, and loop variables, the templaters expose various different libraries and data in `tenv`, to be accessed directly from Lua eval fields:

- All three templaters provide the global environment `_G` of the calling templater to `tenv`, through which all other global variables can be accessed. For example, on the stock templater or KaraOK, Aegisub's `unicode` library can be accessed via `_G.unicode`.
- The stock templater exposed only the `string` and `math` libraries, as seen [here](https://github.com/Aegisub/Aegisub/blob/6f546951b4f004da16ce19ba638bf3eedefb9f31/automation/autoload/kara-templater.lua#L294-L300). The final member `meta` is the map of script metadata fields in the subtitle file's `[Script Info]` section, as [collected by karaskel](https://aegisub.org/docs/latest/automation/lua/modules/karaskel.lua/#karaskelcollect_head).
- In addition to this, KaraOK exposes the `math` libarary, as well as the subtitles object `subs` and various utility functions such as `ipairs` and `tostring`. The full list is [here](https://github.com/logarrhythmic/karaOK/blob/dc26cf017809b3d6ee2fabf01b454b09a6d1413a/autoload/ln.kara-templater-mod.lua#L336-L349).
- The0x's templater exposes all of the libraries that KaraOK does, together with Aegisub's libraries `unicode` and `karaskel`. When available, it also exposes KaraOK's library as `ln` (which is automatically initialized), and The0x's color library as `colorlib`.
The0x's templater does not expose all of the utility functions KaraOK does (`ipairs` being the most notable one), but exposes some other functions such as `require`. See [here](https://github.com/The0x539/Aegisub-Scripts/blob/3cd439b9d2bef2307a1c5725deb03206383b8ad3/src/0x.KaraTemplater.moon#L181) for a full list.
The templater also exposes the `subs`, `meta`, and `styles` objects, and its own utility library [here](https://github.com/The0x539/Aegisub-Scripts/blob/3cd439b9d2bef2307a1c5725deb03206383b8ad3/src/0x.KaraTemplater.moon#L240).

### Inline variables
- The following list is complete with respect to the inline variables in the stock templater and KaraOK. It's in the same order as the [documentation for inline variables in the stock templater](https://aegisub.org/docs/latest/automation/karaoke_templater/inline_variables/), so refer to that for the explanations of these variables.
    - The0x's templater contains additional inline variables for working with loops, as well as the `$env_*` variables - see the source code for these.
- The expressions in the following table are analogues of each other, but they might not be exactly equal. In particular, some values are rounded in the stock templater.
- Many of the expressions listed below for The0x's templater also work for the stock templater and KaraOK.
